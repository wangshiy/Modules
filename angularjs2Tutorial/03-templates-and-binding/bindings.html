<!-- Following kept free of styling to aid in demonstration -->

<h4>My {{version}} Angular App</h4>

<p>Hello, {{person}}</p>

<p [innerText]="person"></p><!-- Angular2 process DOM before plain html, so it can set innerText of the p DOM property; [] is to set DOM property -->

<h4>Expressions</h4>

<p>3 + 4 = {{ 3 + 4 }}</p>

<p>My mother is {{ personObject.mother + "!!" + personObject.siblings[0] + personObject.siblings[1]}}</p>

<p>Test Interface Object {{itfObj[0] + itfObj[1]}}</p>

<p [innerText]="  'My mother is ' + personObject.mother + '!!'  "></p>

<p> Function calls in template bindings are best avoided for
  performance reasons. In earlier Angular versions this did not work at
  all with AOT, but it is now tolerated.</p>
<p>Function result is {{ calculate() }}</p>

<p>This works in development ("JIT") but generates an error with a
   production ("AOT") build:</p>
<!--
<p>Made up variable: {{ madeUpVariableName }}</p>
-->

<h4>Sanitization</h4>

<p>Sanitized by <b>Angular</b>:</p>
<p [innerHtml]="stringWithHtml"></p> <!-- Notice button doesn't appear and this is good because angular2 help u sanitize to prevent XSS attack -->

<p>
  If you bind to innerText, the <b>browser</b> does it
  (note the different output):
</p>
<p [innerText]="stringWithHtml"></p>

<!--
  See the "sanitization" lesson for more information on how
  Angular processes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before they're
  sent to the browser.
