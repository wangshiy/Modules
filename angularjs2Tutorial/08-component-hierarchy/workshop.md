# Workshop for this step

Starting with this workshop, you will mostly add code to your own
application, which you created using CLI.

## Step 1: Add More Components to the Screens (routes)

To do this you will need to identify the primary visual "sections" of
each screen/route. Generally, each group of visually/functionally
related items is represented by a single component. We will help out
for this step and explain which components you need.

```
ng generate component characterName
ng generate component archetypeFilter
ng generate component archetypeList
ng generate component archetypeCard
```

However, if you plan to build something other than a clone of our
example application, choose suitable names -- don't use the word
"archetype" if the things in your application are not archetypes!

## Step 2: Place the Components in the Correct Place

Now that you have some components, it is up to you to place them in
the correct location. Modify the generated HTML files so that the
components are placed in the correct position to satisfy the visual
needs of the requested application's behavior.

## Step 3: Add Static Content to Finish Wireframe Design

Revisit http://swapp.angularbootcamp.com/ for an example of what types
of visual elements should be present in each component. Add these
elements to the corresponding component HTML. These need not function
in any way. This step is to add the necessary HTML. You will
"Angularize" it in upcoming workshops. These elements need not be
stylized. Please focus first on having all of the elements needed and
that they are somewhat semantically correct. If you have time later,
you can go back and style them.
