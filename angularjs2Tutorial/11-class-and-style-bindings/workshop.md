# Workshop for this step

The UI/UX team has decided that the users might benefit from styling
the filter buttons based on the current selection. Add a CSS class
that changes the appearance of the buttons based upon the current
state of the application. If a filter button is clicked, the class
should be applied to indicate this fact visually.

## Step 1: CSS

Create a new CSS class to apply.

## Step 2: class binding

Use ngClass or [class.xyz] to conditionally apply that style to the
appropriate buttons.

We haven't yet learned how to change data with Angular yet - that is
OK, just statically create a few variables to indicate which filter
settings are used, and bind to those.
