# Minimal Protractor Example

This is a minimum feasible Protractor example. It is here in an example
directory by itself, not within the application code. This makes it much more
clear what pieces of all this machinery are Protractor versus application.

This example uses TypeScript so that it can use ES6-style classes. Babel or
another trends dialer could also have been used.

```
npm install
npm start
```
