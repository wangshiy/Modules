# Taste of Angular 2+

This directory contains an example Angular 2+ program, the "tour of
heroes" also available at the Angular website angular.io. You can
experiment with it online:

https://embed.plnkr.co/?show=preview

Or by running a Web server to serve the contents of this directory. For
example live-server can be used:

```
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```

Because this example is intended for online demo use, it actually
requests all of its libraries (in some cases, one file at a time)
online. This is *not* representative of a real Angular 2+ development
workflow.
